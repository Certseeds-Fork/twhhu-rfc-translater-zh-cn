      "text": "The term certificate traces back to the MIT bachelor's thesis of Loren M. Kohnfelder [KOHN]. Kohnfelder, in turn, was responding to a suggestion by Diffie and Hellman in their seminal paper [DH]. Diffie and Hellman noted that with public key cryptography, one no longer needs a secure channel over which to transmit secret keys between communicants. Instead, they suggested, one can publish a modified telephone book -- one with public keys in place of telephone numbers. One could then look up his or her desired communication partner in the directory, find that person's public key and open a secure channel to that person. Kohnfelder took that suggestion and noted that an on-line service has the disadvantage of being a performance bottleneck. To replace it, he proposed creation of digitally signed directory entries which he called certificates. In the time since 1978, the term certificate has frequently been assumed to mean a binding between name and key.",

If it encounters some certificate that it lists, then it annihilates that certificate. If it encounters a previous CRL, as indicated by sequence number, then it annihilates that previous CRL. Such a CRL leads to non-deterministic program behavior. Therefore, we take as a requirement that if SPKI uses CRLs, then the certificate that uses it must explicitly tell the verifier where to find the CRL, the CRL must carry explicit validity dates and the dates of a sequence of CRLs must not overlap. Under this set of requirements, behavior of certificate validation is deterministic (aside from the question of clock skew).",
