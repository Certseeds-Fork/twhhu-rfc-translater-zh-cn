The diffserv WG has defined the general architecture for differentiated services and has focused on the forwarding path behavior required in routers, known as \"per-hop forwarding behaviors\" (or PHBs). The WG has also discussed functionality required at diffserv (DS) domain edges to select (classifiers) and condition (e.g., policing and shaping) traffic according to the rules. Short-term changes in the QoS goals for a DS domain are implemented by changing only the configuration of these edge behaviors without necessarily reconfiguring the behavior of interior network nodes.",

From the end user's point of view, QoS should be supported end-to-end between any pair of hosts. However, this goal is not immediately attainable. It will require interdomain QoS support, and many untaken steps remain on the road to achieving this. One essential step, the evolution of the business models for interdomain QoS, will necessarily develop outside of the IETF. A goal of the diffserv WG is to provide the firm technical foundation that allows these business models to develop. The first major step will be to support edge-to-edge or intradomain QoS between the ingress and egress of a single network, i.e., a DS Domain in the terminology of RFC 2474. The intention is that this edge-to-edge QoS should be composable, in a purely technical sense, to a quantifiable QoS across a DS Region composed of multiple DS domains.",

The classifiers and traffic conditioners are set to reflect the policy and traffic goals for that domain and may be specified in a TCA (Traffic Conditioning Agreement). Once packets have crossed the DS boundary, adherence to diffserv principles makes it possible to group packets solely according to the behavior they receive at each hop (as selected by the DSCP). This approach has well-known scaling advantages, both in the forwarding path and in the control plane. Less well recognized is that these scaling properties only result if the per-hop behavior definition gives rise to a particular type of invariance under aggregation. Since the per-hop behavior must be equivalent for every node in the domain, while the set of packets marked for that PHB may be different at every node, PHBs should be defined such that their characteristics do not depend on the traffic volume of the associated BA on a router's ingress link nor on a particular path through the DS domain taken by the packets. Specifically, different streams of traffic that belong to the same traffic aggregate merge and split as they traverse the network. If the properties of a PDB using a particular PHB hold regardless of how the temporal characteristics of the marked traffic aggregate change as it traverses the domain, then that PDB scales. (Clearly this assumes that numerical parameters such as bandwidth allocated to the particular PDB may be different at different points in the network, and may be adjusted dynamically as traffic volume varies.)

These definitions are intended to be useful tools in configuring DS domains, but the PDB (or PDBs) used by a provider is not expected to be visible to customers any more than the specific PHBs employed in the provider's network would be. Network providers are expected to select their own measures to make customer-visible in contracts and these may be stated quite differently from the technical attributes specified in a PDB definition, though the configuration of a PDB might be taken from a Service Level Specification (SLS). Similarly, specific PDBs are intended as tools for ISPs to construct differentiated services offerings; each may choose different sets of tools, or even develop their own, in order to achieve particular externally observable metrics.

In our example, if domain D allows each of the uplinks to burst p packets into the foo traffic aggregate, the bursts could accumulate as they transit the ring. Packets headed for link L can come from both directions of the ring and back-to-back packets from foo's traffic aggregate can arrive at the same time. If the bandwidth of link L is the same as the links of the ring, this probably does not present a buffering problem. If there are two input links that can send packets to queue for L, at worst, two packets can arrive simultaneously for L. If the bandwidth of link L equals or exceeds twice B, the packets won't accumulate. Further, if p is limited to one, and the bandwidth of L exceeds the rate of arrival (over the longer term) of foo packets (required for bounding the loss) then the queue of foo packets for link L will empty before new packets arrive. If the bandwidth of L is equal to B, one foo packet must queue while the other is transmitted. This would result in N x p back-to- back packets of this traffic aggregate arriving over L during the same time scale as the bursts of p were permitted on the uplinks. Thus, configuring the PDB so that link L can handle the sum of the rates that ingress to the foo PDB doesn't guarantee that L can handle the sum of the N bursts into the foo PDB.",
