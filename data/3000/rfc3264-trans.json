In the model, one participant offers the other a description of the desired session from their perspective, and the other participant answers with the desired session from their perspective. This offer/answer model is most useful in unicast sessions where information from both participants is needed for the complete view of the session.

In other words, the intent of receiving multiple streams of the same type is that they should all be presented in parallel, rather than choosing just one. Another constraint is that when multiple streams are received and sent to the same sink, they MUST be combined in some media specific way. For example, in the case of two audio streams, the received media from each might be mapped to the speakers. In that case, the combining operation would be to mix them. In the case of multiple instant messaging streams, where the sink is the screen, the combining operation would be to present all of them to the user interface. The third constraint is that if multiple sources are mapped to the same stream, those sources MUST be combined in some media specific way before they are sent on the stream.

First, the agent can change ports in addition to changing formats. When media arrives on the new port, it knows that the peer has ceased sending with the old format, and it can cease being prepared to receive with it. This approach has the benefit of being media format independent. However, changes in ports may require changes in resource reservation or rekeying of security protocols. The second approach is to use a totally new set of dynamic payload types for all codecs when one is discarded. When media is received with one of the new payload types, the agent knows that the peer has ceased sending with the old format. This approach doesn't affect reservations or security contexts, but it is RTP specific and wasteful of a very small payload type space. A third approach is to use a timer. When the SDP from the peer is received, the timer is set. When it fires, the agent can cease being prepared to receive with the old format. A value of one minute would typically be more than sufficient. In some cases, an agent may not care, and thus continually be prepared to receive with the old formats.
