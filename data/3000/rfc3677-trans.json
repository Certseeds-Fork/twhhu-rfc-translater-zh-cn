It might also require soliciting feedback from outside the IETF community. There is no question that the individuals that constitute the IETF NomCom each year have the competence to carry out such a search; the issue is that it is a very different task, would require additional time and resources, and therefore is a side effort that could very well undermine the effectiveness of the NomCom in carrying out its primary task for the IETF.",
