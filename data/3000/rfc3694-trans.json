The Geopriv requirements account for circumstances in which the Target has a contractual relationship with the entities that transmit and receive LI and those in which no contract exists. Requiring the Geopriv object to support any technology, Target-Viewer relationship, or underlying legal framework governing LI, complicates the protection of privacy and the security of LI.",

The endpoints of the common Geopriv transactions are the Location Generator (the source of location information from the perspective of the network) and the Location Recipient. Both a Location Generator and a Location Recipient may have a relationship with a Location Server; the Location Generator publishes data to a Location Server (which may provide a grooming/ filtration function for location information), and the Location Recipient requests and/or receives information from the Location Server. This provides two points where Geopriv information could require protection across the wire. Rules can also be passed over the network from a Rule Holder to a Location Server; this provides another point where the architecture requires security.",

Attackers might also wish to prevent a Target's location from being distributed, or to modify or corrupt location information in order to misrepresent the location of the Target, or to redirect the Target's location information to a third party that is not authorized to know this information. Attackers may want to identify the associates of a Target, or learn the habit or routines of a Target. Attackers might want to learn the identity of all of the parties that are in a certain location. Finally, some attackers may simply want to halt the operation of an entire Geopriv system through denial-of-service attacks.",
