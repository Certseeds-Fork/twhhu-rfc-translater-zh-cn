Fundamentally, the IETF parameter assignment function consists of accepting requests for protocol numbers for extensible protocols (such as IP Protocol, PPP PID, TCP/UDP Port, and the like), validating them according to business rules, identifying the appropriate registry, and in some cases portion of a registry, assigning the number, and documenting the result.",

In such a case, IANA needs to know not that \"two PIDs are required\", but that \"two PPP PIDs are required, the data PID named <d-name$gt; defined in section <> from the range 0001..00FF, and the control PID named <c-name$gt; defined in section <> from the range 8001..BFFF\".",

      "text": "As detailed, the function described in RFC 2860 represents approximately a person-equivalent, plus facilities, software support, and standard business loading. This has been the approximate load level for at least the past five years, and is projected to remain about the same for the near future. The cost-effectiveness issues revolve around human-in-the-loop effort involved in reading drafts, investigating inquiries, and such that have been detailed here. The sense is that an effective comment management system plus the work flow systems ICANN is planning to implement should result in a net near term improvement in efficiency and timeliness; projected IETF growth should then consume that improvement over time.",
      "zh-CHS": "如前所述，RFC 2860中描述的功能大约相当于一个人，加上设施、软件支持和标准业务加载。至少在过去五年中，这是近似的负荷水平，预计在不久的将来将保持不变。成本效益问题围绕着阅读草稿、调查查询等过程中的人在回路中的工作展开，本文对此进行了详细介绍。从某种意义上说，一个有效的评论管理系统加上ICANN计划实施的工作流程系统应该在短期内提高效率和及时性；随着时间的推移，预计的IETF增长将消耗这种改进。"
