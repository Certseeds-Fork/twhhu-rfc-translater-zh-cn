He said this \"may be the only way you can teach somebody about copyrights.\" \"If we can find some way to do this without destroying their machines, we'd be interested in hearing about that,\" Mr Hatch was quoted as saying during a Senate hearing.

OP Clients would register with all OP Servers that pertain to the legal jurisdiction in which the client is located each time the computer is started. OP Servers would then, on whatever schedule they have been configured to use, send OP Queries to OP Clients to find out if the computer operator has engaged in an illegal act of interest to the operator of the OP Server.

It could easily be a copy that the user purchased. The OP must be able to tell if a copy is an illegal copy with complete reliability. The OP must be able to differentiate between an original, and legal, copy and a bit-for-bit illegal reproduction. The OP client must be able to differentiate between copies that were created for the purpose of backup, and are thus generally legal, and those copies created for the purpose of illegal distribution. In the case of some types of software, the OP client must be able to determine the intent of the user for the software. An example of this need is related to the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and similar laws around the world. These laws outlaw the possession of circumvention technology, such as crypto analysis software, in most cases. Some exemption is made for legitimate researchers, but without an OP it is quite hard to determine if the circumvention technology is to be used for research or to break copyright protections for the purpose of making illegal copies of protected material. With the OP, the DMCA, and laws like it, can be rewritten so that circumvention technology is legal and developers can find out if their security protocols are any good, something which may be illegal under current law.",

It also requires the use of strong integrity technology to ensure that the messages between the client and server cannot be modified in flight. It also requires strong encryption to be sure that the communication between the client and the server cannot be observed. All of this is required in an environment where many of the users are in full control of their computers and will be actively hostile to the reliable operation of the protocol. Good luck.",
