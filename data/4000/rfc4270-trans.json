Also in early 2005, researchers showed a specific construction of PKIX certificates [RFC3280] that use MD5 for signing [PKIX-MD5-construction], and another researcher showed a faster method for finding MD5 collisions (eight hours on a 1.6-GHz computer) [MD5-faster].",

While it is certainly possible, and at a first glance even probable, that the broken security property will not affect the overall security of many specific Internet protocols, the conservative security approach is to change hash algorithms.

At best, someone could claim that the trusted third party made a mistake by issuing a certificate with the same identity and serial number based on two different public keys. This is indeed far-fetched.",

There is an old saying inside the US National Security Agency (NSA): \"Attacks always get better; they never get worse.\" The current collision attacks against MD5 are easily done on a single computer; the collision attacks against SHA-1 are at the far edge of feasibility today, but will only improve with time. It is preferable to migrate to the new hash standard before there is a panic, instead of after. Just as we all migrated from SHA-0 to SHA-1 based on some unknown vulnerability discovered inside the NSA, we need to migrate from SHA-1 to SHA-256 based on these most recent attacks. SHA-256 has a 256-bit hash length. This length will give us a much larger security margin in the event of newly discovered attacks. Meanwhile, further research inside the cryptographic community over the next several years should point to further improvements in hash algorithm design, and potentially an even more secure hash algorithm.",

Moving from one algorithm to another leads to inevitable lack of interoperability and confusion for typical crypto users.
