Consequently, traffic to that network could be delayed by a path that is longer than necessary. The network could become unreachable from areas where the bogus information is accepted. Traffic might also be forwarded along a path that permits some adversary to view or modify the data. If the bogus information makes it appear that an autonomous system originates a network when it does not, then packets for that network may not be deliverable for the portion of the Internet that accepts the bogus information. A false announcement that an autonomous systems originates a network may also fragment aggregated address blocks in other parts of the Internet and cause routing problems for other networks.",

BGP is operated over interprovider interfaces in which traffic levels push the state of the art in specialized packet forwarding hardware and exceed the performance capabilities of hardware implementation of decryption by many orders of magnitude. The capability of an attacker using a single workstation with high speed interface to generate false traffic for denial of service (DoS) far exceeds the capability of software-based decryption or appropriately-priced cryptographic hardware to detect the false traffic. Under such conditions, one means to protect the network elements from DoS attacks is to use packet-based filtering techniques based on relatively simple inspections of packets. As a result, for an ISP carrying large volumes of traffic, the ability to packet filter on the basis of port numbers is an important protection against DoS attacks, and a necessary adjunct to cryptographic strength in encapsulation.",

To protect Internal BGP (IBGP) sessions, filters are applied at all borders to an ISP network. This removes all traffic destined for network elements' internal addresses (typically contained within a single prefix) and the BGP port number (179). If the BGP port number is found, packets from within an ISP are not forwarded from an internal interface to the BGP speaker's address (on which External BGP (EBGP) sessions are supported), or to a peer's EBGP address. Appropriate router design can limit the risk of compromise when a BGP peer fails to provide adequate filtering. The risk can be limited to the peering session on which filtering is not performed by the peer, or to the interface or line card on which the peering is supported. There is substantial motivation, and little effort is required, for ISPs to maintain such filters.",
