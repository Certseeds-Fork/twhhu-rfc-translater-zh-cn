The basic IDN definition allows a very large number of possible characters in domain names, and this richness may lead to serious user confusion about similar-looking names. To avoid this confusion, the IDN registration process must impose rules that disallow some otherwise-valid name combinations. This document suggests a set of mechanisms that registries might use to define and implement such rules for a broad range of languages, including adaptation of methods developed for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean domain names.",

Additional specifications [RFC3491] [RFC3492] define the mechanisms and tables needed to support IDNA. As work on these specifications neared completion, it became apparent that it would be desirable for registries to impose additional restrictions on the names that could actually be registered (e.g., see [IESG-IDN] and [ICANN-IDN]) to reduce potential confusion among characters that were similar in some way.

For example, while the original DNS specifications [RFC1035] permitted any string of octets in a DNS label, they also recommended the use of a much more restricted subset. This subset was derived from the much older \"hostname\" rules [RFC952] and defined by the \"LDH\" convention (for the three permitted types of characters: letters, digits, and the hyphen). Enforcement of this restricted subset in registrations was the responsibility of the registry or domain administrator. The definition of the subset was embedded in the DNS protocol itself, although some applications protocols, notably those concerned with electronic mail, did impose and enforce similar rules.",

Support for IDNs introduces a very large character repertoire, different geographical and political locations, and languages that require different collections of characters. The optimal registration restrictions are no longer a global matter; they may be different in different areas and, hence, in different DNS zones.",

The script used to write the Arabic language is called \"Arabic\", but it is also used (typically with some additions or deletions) to write a number of other languages. Situations in which a script has a clearly-defined name that is independent of the name of a language are the exception, rather than the rule; examples include Hangul, used to write Korean, Katakana and Hiragana, used to write Japanese, and a few others.

The definition of \"appear similar enough\" will differ for different cultures and circumstance, and hence DNS zones, but the principle is fairly general. In the JET model, all of the variant strings are identified, some are registered into the DNS automatically, and others are simply reserved and can be registered, if at all, only by the original registrant. Other zones might find other policies appropriate. For example, a zone might conclude that having similar strings registered in the DNS was undesirable.

For the subset of characters that actually are ideographs or pictographs, pronunciation is expected to vary widely while meaning is preserved. At least in part because of that similarity of meaning, it made sense in the JET case to permit a registration to specify multiple languages, to verify that the characters in the label string (the requested \"Base registration\") were valid for each, and then to generate variant labels using each language in turn. For many alphabetic languages, it may be more sensible to prohibit the label string submitted for registration from being associated with more than one language. Indeed, \"one label, one language\" has been suggested as an important barrier against common sources of \"look-alike\" confusion. For example, the imposition of that rule in a zone would prevent the insertion of a few Greek or Cyrillic characters with shapes identical to the Latin ones into what was otherwise a Latin-based string. For a particular table, the list of base characters may be thought of as the script associated with the relevant language, with the understanding that the table design does not prevent the same character from appearing in the tables for multiple languages.",

In the former case, the rules and conventions can be established before any registrations occur. In the latter, there may be conflicts or opportunities for confusion between existing registrations and now-permitted Roman-based characters that do not appear in ASCII.

More generally, the more one moves toward \"language\"-based registry restrictions, the less it is going to be possible to construct labels out of fanciful strings.
