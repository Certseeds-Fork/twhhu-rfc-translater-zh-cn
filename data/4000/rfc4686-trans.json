The DKIM protocol defines a mechanism by which email messages can be cryptographically signed, permitting a signing domain to claim responsibility for the use of a given email address. Message recipients can verify the signature by querying the signer's domain directly to retrieve the appropriate public key, and thereby confirm that the message was attested to by a party in possession of the private key for the signing domain. This document addresses threats relative to two works in progress by the DKIM Working Group, the DKIM signature specification [DKIM-BASE] and DKIM Sender Signing Practices [DKIM-SSP].",

For DKIM, this means that a sender might create a \"good\" message and a \"bad\" message, where some filter at the signing party's site would sign the good message but not the bad message. The attacker gets the good message signed, and then incorporates that signature in the bad message.
