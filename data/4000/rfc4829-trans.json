A centralized approach would be more precise, but require that the whole network state be stored and updated accordingly, which raises scalability issues. In a network where LSPs are mostly static, an offline decision can be made to reroute LSPs and the centralized approach could be appropriate. However, in a dynamic network in which LSPs are set up and torn down in a frequent manner because of new TE LSPs, bandwidth increase, reroute due to failure, etc., the correctness of the stored network state could be questionable. Moreover, the setup time is generally increased when compared to a distributed solution. In this scenario, the distributed approach would bring more benefits, even when resulting in a non-optimal solution (The gain in optimality of a centralized approach compared to a distributed approach depends on many factors: network topology, traffic matrix, TE strategy, etc.). A distributed approach is also easier to be implemented due to the distributed nature of the current Internet protocols.",
