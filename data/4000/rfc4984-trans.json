The primary goal of the workshop was to develop a shared understanding of the problems that the large backbone operators are facing regarding the scalability of today's Internet routing system. The key workshop findings include an analysis of the major factors that are driving routing table growth, constraints in router technology, and the limitations of today's Internet addressing architecture. It is hoped that these findings will serve as input to the IETF community and help identify next steps towards effective solutions.",

Several scalability problems of the current routing and addressing systems were discussed, most related to the size of the DFZ routing table (frequently referred to as the Routing Information Base, or RIB) and its implications. Those implications included (but were not limited to) the sizes of the DFZ RIB and FIB (the Forwarding Information Base), the cost of recomputing the FIB, concerns about the BGP convergence times in the presence of growing RIB and FIB sizes, and the costs and power (and hence heat dissipation) properties of the hardware needed to route traffic in the core of the Internet.",

      "text": "Presentations made at the workshop showed that the DFZ RIB has been growing at greater than linear rates for several years [DFZ]. While this has the obvious effects on the requirements for RIB and FIB memory sizes, the growth driven by prefix de-aggregation also exposes the core of the network to the dynamic nature of the edges, i.e., the de-aggregation leads to an increased number of BGP UPDATE messages injected into the DFZ (frequently referred to as \"UPDATE churn\"). Consequently, additional processing is required to maintain state for the longer prefixes and to update the FIB. Note that, although the size of the RIB is bounded by the given address space size and the number of reachable hosts (i.e., O(m*2^32) for IPv4, where <m> is the average number of peers each BGP router may have), the amount of protocol activity required to distribute dynamic topological changes is not. That is, the amount of BGP UPDATE churn that the network can experience is essentially unbounded. It was also noted that the UPDATE churn, as currently measured, is heavy-tailed [ATNAC2006]. That is, a relatively small number of Autonomous Systems (ASs) or prefixes are responsible for a disproportionately large fraction of the UPDATE churn that we observe today. Furthermore, much of the churn may turn out to be unnecessary information, possibly due to instability of edge ASs being injected into the global routing system [DynPrefix], or arbitrage of some bandwidth pricing model (see [GIH], for example, or the discussion of the behavior of AS 9121 in [BGP2005]).",
      "zh-CHS": "研讨会上的演示表明，DFZ肋骨数年来一直以高于线性的速度增长[DFZ]。虽然这对RIB和FIB内存大小的要求有明显的影响，但前缀反聚合驱动的增长也使网络核心暴露于边缘的动态特性，即反聚合导致注入DFZ的BGP更新消息数量增加（通常称为“更新搅动”）。因此，需要额外的处理来维护较长前缀的状态并更新FIB。注意，尽管RIB的大小受给定地址空间大小和可访问主机数量的限制（即IPv4的O（m*2^32），其中<m>是每个BGP路由器可能拥有的对等节点的平均数量），但分发动态拓扑更改所需的协议活动量并不是。也就是说，网络可以经历的BGP更新波动量基本上是无限的。还注意到，目前测量的更新客户流失率是重尾的[ATNAC2006]。也就是说，相对较少的自治系统（ASs）或前缀导致了我们今天所观察到的大部分更新搅动。此外，许多搅动可能是不必要的信息，可能是由于注入全局路由系统[DynPrefix]的边缘ASs的不稳定性，或某些带宽定价模型的套利（例如，参见[GIH]，或[BGP2005]中AS 9121行为的讨论）。"

      "text": "Finally, it was noted by the workshop participants that the UPDATE churn situation may be exacerbated by the current Regional Internet Registry (RIR) policy in which end sites are allocated Provider-Independent (PI) addresses. These addresses are not topologically aggregatable, and as such, bring the churn problem described above into the core routing system. Of course, as noted by several participants, the RIRs have no real choice in this matter, as many enterprises demand PI addresses that allow them to multihome without the \"provider lock\" that Provider-Allocated (PA) [PIPA] address space creates. Some enterprises also find the renumbering cost associated with PA address assignments unacceptable.",
      "zh-CHS": "最后，研讨会参与者指出，当前的区域互联网注册（RIR）政策可能会加剧更新流失情况，在该政策中，终端站点被分配独立于提供商（PI）的地址。这些地址在拓扑上是不可聚合的，因此，将上面描述的客户流失问题引入核心路由系统。当然，正如几位参与者所指出的，RIR在这方面没有真正的选择，因为许多企业需要PI地址，允许他们在没有提供商分配（PA）[PIPA]地址空间创建的“提供商锁”的情况下多址。一些企业还发现与PA地址分配相关的重新编号成本是不可接受的。"

A commonly held wisdom is that Moore's law would save the day by ensuring that technology will continue to scale at historical rates that surpass the growth rate of routing information handled by core router hardware. However, Li pointed out that Moore's Law does not apply to building high-end routers as far as the cost is concerned.",

In particular, off-chip SRAM is commonly used for storing FIB data, and the driver for low-latency, high-capacity SRAM used to be PC cache memory. However, recently cache memory has been migrating directly onto the processor die, and cell phones are now the primary driver for off-chip SRAM. Given cell phones require low-power, small-capacity parts that are not applicable to high-end routers, the SRAMs that are favored for router design are not volume parts and do not track with Moore's law.",

Once this constraint is lifted by the deployment of IPv6, and in the absence of a scalable routing strategy, the rapid DFZ RIB size growth problem today can potentially be exacerbated by IPv6's much larger address space. The only routing paradigm available today for IPv6 is a combination of Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) [RFC4632] and Provider-Independent (PI) address allocation strategies [PIPA] (and possibly SHIM6 [SHIM6] when that technology is developed and deployed). Thus, the opportunity exists to create a \"swamp\" (unaggregatable address space) that can be many orders of magnitude larger than what we faced with IPv4. In short, the advent of IPv6 and its larger address space further underscores both the concerns raised in Section 2.1, and the importance of resolving the architectural issue raised in Section 2.2.",

Because of the longest-matching prefix forwarding rule, in this case, the customer's traffic will be directed through the non-primary AS(s).

DRAM speed, however, only grows about 10% per year, or 1.2x every 2 years [DRAM] [Molinero]. This is an issue because BGP convergence time is limited by DRAM access speeds. In processing a BGP update, a BGP speaker receives a path and must compare it to all of the other paths it has stored for the prefix. It then iterates over all of the prefixes in the update stream. This results in a memory access pattern that has proven to limit the effectiveness of processor caching. As a result, BGP convergence time degrades at the routing table growth rate, divided by the speed improvement rate of DRAM. In the long run, this is likely to become a significant issue.",

The milestone of sending a completed chip design to a fabricator for manufacturing is known as 'tapeout', and is the point where the designer pays for the fixed overhead of putting the chip into production. The costs of taping out a chip have been rising about 1.5x every 2 years, driven by new process technology. The actual design and development costs have been rising similarly, because each new generation of technology increases the device count by roughly a factor of 2. This allows new features and chip architectures, which inevitably lead to an increase in complexity and labor costs. If new chip development was driven solely by the need to scale up memory, and if memory structures scaled, then we would expect labor costs to remain fixed. Unfortunately, memory structures typically do not seem to scale linearly. Individual memory controllers have a non-negligible cost, leading to the design for an internal on-chip interconnect of memories. The net result is that we can expect that chip development costs to continue to escalate roughly in line with the increases in tapeout costs, leading to an ongoing cost curve of about 1.5x every 2 years. Since each technology step roughly doubles memory, that implies that if demand grows faster than about (2x/1.5x) = 1.3x per year, then technology refresh will not be able to remain on a constant cost curve.",
