A key factor in the handling of such calls is the ability of the system to determine caller location and to route the call to the appropriate Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) based on that location. With the introduction of IP-based telephony and multimedia services, support for emergency calling via the Internet also has to be provided. Two core components of IP-based emergency calling include an emergency service identifier and a mapping protocol. The emergency service identifier indicates that the call signaling establishes an emergency call, while the mapping protocol translates the emergency service identifier and the caller's geographic location into an appropriate PSAP URL.",

One possibility is that mapping clients are misled into sending mapping queries to the target of the attack instead of the mapping server. Prevention of such an attack is an operational issue rather than one of protocol design. Another possible attack is where the mapping server is tricked into sending responses to the target of the attack through spoofing of the source address in the query.",
