When a WG finishes an effort, the WG's output will only be useful if it actually solves a real, compelling problem faced by the actual user of the technology (i.e., the customer or operator). Unfortunately, there have been more than a few IETF WGs whose output was not adopted, and in some of those cases the cause was a lack of understanding of the real problem the operator had.

It might surprise some, but there is no actual process requirement to have a BOF prior to forming a WG. The actual process requirement is simply that the IESG (together with the AD(s) sponsoring the work) approve a formal charter as described in [RFC2418]. In practice, BOFs are used to engage the broader community on proposed work and to help produce an acceptable charter.",
      "zh-CHS": "本文件强调了允许并积极参与关于成立工作组优点的广泛公众讨论的必要性。这可能会让一些人感到惊讶，但在形成工作组之前，并没有实际的流程要求有一个转炉。实际的过程要求只是IESG（连同赞助工程的AD）批准[RFC2418]中所述的正式章程。在实践中，BOF用于让更广泛的社区参与拟议的工作，并帮助制定可接受的章程。"

First, BOFs are often held not because they are (strictly speaking) required, but because it is assumed they are needed or because ADs feel that a BOF would be beneficial in terms of getting additional public participation. Hence, those interested in forming a WG should give serious consideration to using the steps outlined above not just for the purposes of creating a BOF, but to convince the IESG and the broader community that a BOF is not even needed, as there is already demonstrated, strong consensus that a WG should be formed. Second, the IESG should not forget that BOFs are simply a tool, and may not even be the best tool in every situation.",
      "zh-CHS": "这里有两个观察结果。首先，举办BOF通常不是因为（严格地说）需要它们，而是因为假设它们是需要的，或者因为广告认为BOF在获得更多公众参与方面是有益的。因此，那些有兴趣成立工作组的人应该认真考虑使用上述步骤，不仅仅是为了创建BOF，而是为了说服IESG和更广泛的社区，甚至不需要BOF，正如已经证明的那样，应该成立工作组的强烈共识。其次，IESG不应忘记，BOF只是一种工具，甚至可能不是所有情况下的最佳工具。"
