      "text": "DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) allows an organization to claim responsibility for transmitting a message, in a way that can be validated by a recipient. The organization can be the author's, the originating sending site, an intermediary, or one of their agents. A message can contain multiple signatures, from the same or different organizations involved with the message. DKIM defines a domain-level digital signature authentication framework for email, using public key cryptography and using the domain name service as its key server technology. This permits verification of a responsible organization, as well as the integrity of the message content. DKIM will also provide a mechanism that permits potential email signers to publish information about their email signing practices; this will permit email receivers to make additional assessments about messages. DKIM's authentication of email identity can assist in the global control of \"spam\" and \"phishing\". This document provides implementation, deployment, operational, and migration considerations for DKIM.",

      "text": "DKIM participates in a trust-oriented enhancement to the Internet's email service, to facilitate message handling decisions, such as for delivery and for content display. Trust-oriented message handling has substantial differences from the more established approaches that consider messages in terms of risk and abuse. With trust, there is a collaborative exchange between a willing participant along the sending path and a willing participant at a recipient site. In contrast, the risk model entails independent, unilateral action by the recipient site, in the face of a potentially unknown, hostile, and deceptive sender. This translates into a very basic technical difference: in the face of unilateral action by the recipient and even antagonistic efforts by the sender, risk-oriented mechanisms are based on heuristics, that is, on guessing. Guessing produces statistical results with some false negatives and some false positives. For trust-based exchanges, the goal is the deterministic exchange of information. For DKIM, that information is the one identifier that represents a stream of mail for which an independent assessment is sought (by the signer).",
      "zh-CHS": "DKIM参与了对Internet电子邮件服务的信任增强，以促进邮件处理决策，如发送和内容显示。面向信任的消息处理与考虑消息和风险的更为成熟的方法有很大的差异。有了信任，发送路径上的自愿参与者和接收方站点上的自愿参与者之间就可以进行协作交换。相反，风险模型要求接收方站点在面对潜在未知、敌对和欺骗性发件人时采取独立、单方面的行动。这就转化为一个非常基本的技术差异：面对接受者的单方面行动，甚至是发送者的对抗性努力，面向风险的机制是基于启发式的，即猜测。猜测会产生一些假阴性和假阳性的统计结果。对于基于信任的交换，目标是确定的信息交换。对于DKIM，该信息是表示（签名者）寻求独立评估的邮件流的唯一标识符。"

      "text": "A trust-based service is built upon a validated Responsible Identifier that labels a stream of mail and is controlled by an identity (role, person, or organization). The identity is acknowledging some degree of responsibility for the message stream. Given a basis for believing that an identifier is being used in an authorized manner, the recipient site can make and use an assessment of the associated identity. An identity can use different identifiers, on the assumption that the different streams might produce different assessments. For example, even the best-run marketing campaigns will tend to produce some complaints that can affect the reputation of the associated identifier, whereas a stream of transactional messages is likely to have a more pristine reputation.",

      "text": "Determining that the identifier's use is valid is quite different from determining that the content of a message is valid. The former means only that the identifier for the responsible role, person, or organization has been legitimately associated with a message. The latter means that the content of the message can be believed and, typically, that the claimed author of the content is correct. DKIM validates only the presence of the identifier used to sign the message. Even when this identifier is validated, DKIM carries no implication that any of the message content, including the RFC5322.From field [RFC5322], is valid. Surprisingly, this limit to the semantics of a DKIM signature applies even when the validated signing identifier is the same domain name as is used in the RFC5322.From field! DKIM's only claim about message content is that the content cited in the DKIM-Signature: field's h= tag has been delivered without modification. That is, it asserts message content integrity -- between signing and verifying -- not message content validity.",

The recipient then makes handling decisions based on a collection of assessments, of which the DKIM mechanism is only a part. In this model, as shown in Figure 1, validation is an intermediary step, having the sole task of passing a validated Responsible Identifier to the Identity Assessor. The communication is of a single Responsible Identifier that the Responsible Identity wishes to have used by the Identity Assessor. The Identifier is the sole, formal input and output value of DKIM signing. The Identity Assessor uses this single, provided Identifier for consulting whatever assessment databases are deemed appropriate by the assessing entity. In turn, output from the Identity Assessor is fed into a Handling Filter",
