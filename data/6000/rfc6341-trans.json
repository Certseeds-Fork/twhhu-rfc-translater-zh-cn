For example, in a call center, agents will be subject to policies of the call center and may or may not have the right to prevent the recording of a CS or part of a CS. Users calling into the call center, on the other hand, will typically have to ask the agent not to record the CS. If the agent is unable to prevent recording, or if the caller does not trust the agent, the only option generally is to terminate the CS.",
      "zh-CHS": "参与者记录通知的要求因司法管辖区而异。在给定的部署中，并非所有用户都有权停止CS的录制（尽管任何用户都可以终止参与CS）。通常，域内执行录制的用户将遵守该域关于是否录制CSs的策略。例如，在呼叫中心，代理将遵守呼叫中心的政策，可能有权也可能没有权阻止录制CS或CS的一部分。另一方面，呼叫呼叫中心的用户通常必须要求代理不要记录CS。如果代理无法阻止录制，或者如果调用方不信任代理，通常唯一的选择是终止CS。"

Typical issues are who can access the recording (e.g., receive a copy of the recording, view the metadata, play back the media, etc.), for what purpose the recording can be used (e.g., for training purposes, for quality control purposes, etc.), and for how long the recording is to be retained before deletion. These are typically policies of the domain that makes the recording, rather than policies of individual users involved in a recorded CS, whether those users be in the same domain or in a different domain. Taking the call center example again, agents might be made aware of call center policy regarding retention and use of recordings as part of their employment contract, and callers from outside the call center might be given some information about policy when notified that a CS will be recorded (e.g., through an announcement that says that calls may be recorded for quality purposes).",
