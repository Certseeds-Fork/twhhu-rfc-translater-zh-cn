In contrast, the default IPv6 subnet size is a /64, a number so large it covers trillions of addresses, the overwhelming number of which will be unassigned. Consequently, simplistic implementations of Neighbor Discovery (ND) can be vulnerable to deliberate or accidental denial of service (DoS), whereby they attempt to perform address resolution for large numbers of unassigned addresses. Such denial-of-service attacks can be launched intentionally (by an attacker) or result from legitimate operational tools or accident conditions. As a result of these vulnerabilities, new devices may not be able to \"join\" a network, it may be impossible to establish new IPv6 flows, and existing IPv6 transported flows may be interrupted.",

When such probes are directed via a router, and the target addresses are on a directly attached network, the router will attempt to perform address resolution on a large number of destinations (i.e., some fraction of the 2^64 addresses on the subnet). The router's process of testing for the (non)existence of neighbors can induce a denial-of-service condition, where the number of necessary Neighbor Discovery requests overwhelms the implementation's capacity to process them, exhausts available memory and replaces existing in-use mappings with incomplete entries that will never be completed. A directed DoS attack may seek to intentionally create similar conditions to those created unintentionally by a network scan. The resulting network disruption may impact existing traffic, and devices that join the network may find that address resolution attempts fail. The DoS as a consequence of network scanning was previously described in [RFC5157].",

By carefully addressing machines into a small portion of a subnet (such as the lowest numbered addresses), it is possible to filter access to addresses not in that assigned portion of address space using Access Control Lists (ACLs), or by null routing, features which are available on most existing platforms. This will prevent the attacker from making the router attempt to resolve unused addresses. For example, if there are only 50 hosts connected to an interface, you may be able to filter any address above the first 64 addresses of that subnet by null-routing the subnet carrying a more specific /122 route or by applying ACLs on the WAN link to prevent the attack traffic reaching the vulnerable device.",

For example, the network 2001:db8:1:2:3::/64 could be routed to a discard interface on \"border\" routers, and then individual hosts could announce 2001:db8:1:2:3::10/128, 2001:db8:1:2: 3::66/128 into the IGP. This is typically done by having the IP address bound to a virtual interface on the host (for example, the loopback interface), enabling IP forwarding on the host and having it run a routing daemon. For obvious reasons, host participation in the IGP makes many operators uncomfortable, but it can be a very powerful technique if used in a disciplined and controlled manner. One method to help address these concerns is to have the hosts participate in a different IGP (or difference instance of the same IGP) and carefully redistribute into the main IGP.",
