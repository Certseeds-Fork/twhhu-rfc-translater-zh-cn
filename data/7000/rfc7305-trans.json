The workshop was hosted by the University of Cambridge on December 4th and 5th of 2013 in Cambridge, UK. The goal of the workshop was to facilitate adoption of Internet protocols, through examination of a variety of economic models, with particular emphasis at the waist of the hourglass (e.g., the middle of the protocol stack). This report summarizes contributions and discussions. As the topics were wide ranging, there is no single set of recommendations for IETF participants to pursue at this time. Instead, in the classic sense of early research, the workshop noted areas that deserve further exploration.",

      "text": "The Internet is a complex ecosystem that encompasses all aspects of society. At its heart is a protocol stack with an hourglass shape, and IP at its center. Recent research points to possible explanations for the success of such a design and for the significant challenges that arise when trying to evolve or change its middle section, e.g., as partially evident in the difficulties encountered by IPv6. The workshop had a number of other key examples to consider, including the next generation of HTTP and real time web-browser communications (WebRTC). The eventual success of many if not all of these protocols will largely depend on our understanding of not only what features and design principles contribute lasting value, but also how deployment strategies can succeed in unlocking that value to foster protocol adoption. The latter is particularly important in that most if not all Internet protocols exhibit strong externalities that create strong barriers to adoption, especially in the presence of a well-established incumbent. That is, factors beyond the control of the end points (such as middleboxes) can limit deployment, sometimes by design.",
      "zh-CHS": "互联网是一个复杂的生态系统，涵盖了社会的各个方面。它的核心是一个沙漏形状的协议栈，IP位于其中心。最近的研究指出了这种设计成功的可能解释，以及在尝试发展或改变其中间部分时出现的重大挑战，例如，IPv6遇到的困难部分地证明了这一点。该研讨会有许多其他重要的例子要考虑，包括下一代HTTP和实时Web浏览器通信（WebRTC）。许多（如果不是所有的话）协议的最终成功将在很大程度上取决于我们对哪些功能和设计原则有助于持久价值的理解，也取决于部署策略如何成功地释放该价值以促进协议的采用。后者尤其重要，因为大多数（如果不是所有的话）互联网协议都表现出强大的外部性，这给采用造成了巨大的障碍，特别是在有一个公认的现任者在场的情况下。也就是说，超出端点控制范围的因素（如中间盒）可能会限制部署，有时是通过设计。"

One of the workshop's goals was, therefore, to encourage discussions to develop an understanding of what makes protocol designs successful not only in meeting initial design goals but more importantly in their ability to evolve as these goals and the available technology change. Another equally important goal was to develop protocol deployment strategies that ensure that new features can rapidly gain enough of a foothold to ultimately realize broad adoption. Such strategies must be informed by both operational considerations and economic factors.",

There are numerous instances where progress has been slow, the three biggest that come to mind being IPv6 [RFC2480], the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) [RFC4960], and DNS Security (DNSSEC) [RFC4034]. The impact of DNSSEC is of particular interest, because it is relied upon for the delivery of other services, such as DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) [RFC6698], and it could be used for application discovery services through DNS (specifically where security properties are part of that discovery). Thus, slowdown at the neck of the glass can have an impact closer to the lip.",

The first was that the Internet Architecture Board should review and consider that document in the context of evaluating Birds of a Feather (BoF) session proposals at the IETF, so that any working group proposal is carefully crafted to address a specific design space and provide positive net value. Another aspect was to continue work on tracking the value-specific works in terms of success, wild success, or failure.

Two current examples include DANE atop DNSSEC and WebRTC atop SCTP. The workshop reviewed a model [Weber13] that explores how bundling of two technologies may lead to increased or decreased adoption of one or both. This will depend on a number of factors, including costs, benefits, and externalities associated with each technology. (Simply put, an externality is an effect or use decision by one set of parties that has either a positive or negative impact on others who did not have a choice or whose interests were not taken into account.) Bundling of capabilities may provide positive value when individual capabilities on their own do not provide sufficient critical mass to propel further adoption. Specifically, bundling can help when one technology does not provide positive value until critical mass of deployment exists, and where a second technology has low adoption cost and immediate value and hence drives initial adoption until enough of a user base exists to allow critical mass sufficient for the first technology to get positive value. One question was what happens where one technology depends on the other. That is directly tied to \"mandatory to implement\" discussions within the IETF. That is a matter for follow-on work. IETF participants can provide researchers anecdotal experience to help improve models in this area.",
