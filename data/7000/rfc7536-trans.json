The panel needs to include a representative sample of the operator's technologies and broadband speeds. For instance, it might encompass speeds ranging from below 8 Mbps to over 100 Mbps. The operator would like the end-to-end view of the service, rather than just the access portion. This involves relating the pure network parameters to something like a 'mean opinion score' [MOS], which will be service dependent (for instance, web-browsing QoE is largely determined by latency above a few Mbps).",

The other approach is passive measurements on the customer's ordinary traffic; the advantage is that it measures what the customer actually does, but it creates extra variability (different traffic mixes give different results) and, in particular, it raises privacy concerns.
