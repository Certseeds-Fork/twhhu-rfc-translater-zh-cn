For a number of years, the IAOC has improvised by defaulting to an informal process of having the transition occur during the administrative plenary (as the IESG does). This informal arrangement violates the letter of BCP 101. But even this arrangement is problematic if the transfer happens after the IAOC's face-to-face meeting takes place that week. Under the informal arrangement, the IAOC typically meets on the morning of the administrative plenary, which means that the incoming IAOC members, while present, are not seated.",
      "zh-CHS": "RFC 4071[BCP101]第4节规定，“IAOC的任期通常在一年中第一次IETF会议结束时结束。”事实证明，IAOC成员的任期在一年中第一次IETF会议结束时到期，对于IAOC在会议周内开展业务和选举主席是不切实际的。多年来，IAOC一直在临时安排，默认在行政全体会议期间进行非正式的过渡（正如IESG所做的那样）。这种非正式安排违反了BCP 101的规定。但如果转会发生在国际奥委会当面会议后，即使是这样的安排也是有问题的。根据非正式安排，IAOC通常在行政全体会议的上午举行会议，这意味着IAOC的新任成员在出席会议时没有就座。"

      "text": "Having the new IAOC members take office after the face-to-face meeting has caused difficulties in the chair selection and voting processes during the IAOC's face-to-face meeting held during the same week. There has been confusion over who should vote in the chair election and on any business actions that require a vote of the Trustees. If the incoming members are not seated, then they should not vote; however, to select a chair for the next year, for example, they, more than the outgoing members, should have a say in the chair selection. There is also confusion over who is eligible to be elected as chair -- if the term of an IAOC member has not yet started, could that IAOC member be elected chair (as the chair is selected from among the members). Having the terms expire at the end of the week also risks the IAOC not being able to raise a quorum if outgoing members decide to not come to the meeting. Because the IAOC members are the Trustees of the IETF Trust, the same issues arise with the IETF Trust and its ability to carry out its business and elect a Chair during the meeting week.",
