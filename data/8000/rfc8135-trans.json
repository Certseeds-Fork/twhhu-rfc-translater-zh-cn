Further, these fixed addresses have been proven unsuitable for mobility and virtualization in today's world, where cloud computing defies the traditional fixed addressing model. The increased size of addresses as allowed in IPv6, the significant drop in price of floating-point hardware, and the availability of a well-established floating-point format in IEEE 754 [IEEE754] allow for taking not only the step to floating-point addressing but also the step to complex addressing.",
