      "text": "Many IAOC positions are filled by members who are already members of IETF leadership and are subject to review by the nominating committee. This means that limiting an IAOC liaison to one of the sitting members would mean that in some years the only individuals eligible to serve as liaison for the nominating committee would be sitting members of the IAOC that a) were appointed by the previous nominating committee and are not being by the current nominating committee, or b) were appointed by the IAB or IESG and are not being reviewed by the current IAB or IESG. \"Eligible\" does not also mean \"willing and able to serve\", so it is possible that an IAOC might find itself with no sitting member to send as advisor in some years.",
      "zh-CHS": "许多IAOC职位由已经是IETF领导层成员的成员担任，并接受提名委员会的审查。这意味着，将IAOC联络限制在其中一名现任成员将意味着在某些年份，唯一有资格担任提名委员会联络人的个人将是IAOC现任成员，a）由前一个提名委员会任命，而不是由现任提名委员会任命，或b）由IAB或IESG任命，且未接受当前IAB或IESG的审查。“合格”并不意味着“愿意并能够服务”，因此，IAOC可能会发现自己在某些年内没有现任成员作为顾问。"

If any given IAOC thought that was important, they could certainly continue to suggest sitting members, but if no sitting member was willing and able to serve, the IAOC would be free to do the next best thing and would likely be the best qualified group to decide who to send.",
