The main constraint is that the signal's expressed URNs must be semantic supersets of (i.e., identical to or a prefix of) the URNs corresponding to the symbols in the state's label. In particular, if the expressed URN of the signal in a certain category is shorter than the state's label, we show that in the state's name by putting parentheses around the trailing part of the symbol that is not expressed by the signal.

This algorithm will use at most linear time and constant space to process a sequence of \"alert\" URNs. This is significantly more efficient than the algorithm of [RFC7462] and minimizes the security vulnerabilities of this processing step that are due to resource consumption.",

      "text": "However, the process defined in this document for constructing an FSM can use more than linear time and constant space -- probably exponential time and space in the worst case. This SHOULD be taken into consideration whenever an FSM is constructed using this algorithm and MUST be taken into consideration when it is done dynamically by a UA. Whenever an FSM is constructed by a process that is not under the direct supervision of a human user, procedures MUST be used to ensure that (1) the processing and memory consumption are limited to acceptable amounts and (2) if the FSM construction is aborted due to excessive consumption, the designated consumers of the FSM MUST have appropriate fallback procedures.",
